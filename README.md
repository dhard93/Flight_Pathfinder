This c++ program reads in a list of cities served by an airline and a list of flights from data files and creates a flight graph.
The user is then prompted to enter an origin and destination city.
If both cities are valid cities served by the airline, then it will find all possible paths from origin to destination and output them to the
console in ascending order of total cost.

In makefile, change compiler to your c++ compiler (g++ by default)

To Run:
./Run
